# Assignment #1: Design an app to calculate the gas law

## Variables: 
- Pv = nRT
- Where P is pressure and a float value.
- V is the volume in meters cube
- N is the number of moles
- R is the gas constant with a value of 8.314
- T is temperature.

## What to expect:
- Ask the user to input the value for pressure P
- Ask the user to enter the length, width, and height and automatically develop a variable to calculate the volume using those variables.
- Ask the user for the temperature and add 273.14 to the value.
- All of the parameters are of type float.
- Calculate the number of moles. Round up the number to the nearest whole number.
- If the value is even, turn it into an odd value, and if it's odd, turn it into an even value.
- Display the initial value for the mole, the rounded whole number in type float, and the odd or even value after.

## Notes: 
- Created using Visual Studio Code
